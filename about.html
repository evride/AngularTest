	I was asked to make this simple webapp to demonstrate my AngularJS programming skills. It serves no other purpose. The source for this webapp can be found on <a href="http://github.com/evride/AngularTest">Github</a>.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
	
	I am a fullstack LAMP developer. My two current live projects are <a href="http://repables.com">Repables.com</a>, a 3D file repository geared towards 3D printing and <a href="http://github.com/evride/Skylight">Skylight</a>, a desktop application written in Python to control SLA 3D printers.</div>
